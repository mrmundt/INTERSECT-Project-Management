## Hands-On Setup: MoSCoW 

Use your GitHub repo from yesterday's "Issues Tracking" session and add Issue
labels for "Must have", "Should have", "Could have", and "Won't have"

## Hands-On Setup: Kanban 

Create a GitHub Kanban project board

## Lesson Plan

Sprint Planning:

- In a group of about four:
    - Create a Work Backlog based on the User Stories on the right, expressed as GitHub issues
    - Rate your issues for the "next" sprint using MoSCoW 
- Individually:
    - Populate the Work Backlog section with all of your issues
    - Move those rated "Must have" and "Should have" to "Ready to be Developed"

User Stories:

- As a user, I can display my image data using preexisting tools
- As a user, I can specify an input and an output file name
- As a user, if I donâ€™t specify an output file name, a reasonable one is generated
- As a user, I can display "before" and "after" images such that I can easily see differences

## Debrief 

- Did you  encounter any problems during the activities?
- Do you think you could use these techniques in your own projects? 
- Are there any areas where you would modify or customize the recommendations for your context?
