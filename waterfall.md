## The Waterfall Model

The idea of having defined phases is to try to complete each phase before
the next phase begins.
This is generally referred to as the waterfall model, ala "Progress flows
downwards through the phases, like a waterfall."
Each phase produces specific deliverables, which feed into the next phase with
the assumption that the artifacts from the previous phases are actually correct.

Ideally, each phase will also identify any issues or flaws in the previous phase.
When this happens, you are supposed to iterate between phases to fix any issues that arise.

## The Waterfall Model in Real Life

It is very common in real life scenarios that there is a miscommunication of software requirements.
These miscommunications may not even be identified until the software is demonstrated
for clients or formal acceptance testing is completed.
In traditional waterfall models, the client is often only involved in requirements
phase, and in acceptance-testing or later phases.

If mistakes occur using the Waterfall model, very significant amounts of work
may need to be reviewed, revised, or even discarded.

## What do you require?

"It's 50x to 200x less expensive to get a requirement right in the first place
than to fix a requirement after implementation." - Boehm and Papaccio, 1988

The Waterfall model works well when:

- Software requirements are very clear, well understood, and unchanging
- Technical implementation details are also very well understood (Generally considered more suited to manufacturing, but this is also changing with rapid prototyping!)

Inversely, waterfall model works terribly when these things aren't present and
can lead to greatly exceeding time and financial budgets.
Waterfall-based models don't handle lack of knowledge, or change, very effectively.
Poorly understood or changing software requirements, technology, or
architecture choices can negatively impact the performance of the Waterfall-model.
Though, it should be noted that a lack of software-engineering discipline kills virtually all approaches.

Agile methodologies were suggested as a better alternative to Waterfall-based methods
and are discussed in the next section.
